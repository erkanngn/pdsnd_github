UDACITY Bikeshare-Data Project II
Overview
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
What Software Do I Need?
Its required the following software:
•	Python
•	A terminal application
Questions and Answering
You can answer the following questions about with the bike share data:
•	What month occurs most often in the start time?
•	What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time?
•	What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
•	What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
•	What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
•	What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
•	What are the counts of each user type?
•	What are the counts of gender?
•	What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?
